## Nernst Equation: Changing Concentrations and Temperature

Click the button below to open a Jupyter notebook. Navigate to the Nernst.ipynb and run all of the cells to obtain a graph to observe the variation in the cell potential of a cell with a change in the ratio of concentrations of ions in the electrolyte. The effect of varying the temperature can also be observed by toggling the temperature value.
